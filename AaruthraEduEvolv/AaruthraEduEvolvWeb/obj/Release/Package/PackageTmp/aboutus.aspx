						<p>Education- A form of learning, transfers knowledge and skills of a group of people from one generation to another through teaching, training or research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of others, but may also be autodidactic (self taught learning). Proudly exclaiming, such an effort has been taken by Veera' Education, to give an autodidactic learning to people nationally and globally who thrive for the need of language, which always has been the stumbling block, for one's growth and success.</p>
						<p>Veera's Education being incorporated on 04th October 2012 with the Trade Mark(TM) registration, is started with a view to provide enormous education in language specialized in English and Hindi. Though incorporated as Veera' Education, it had had its foundation as Veera's Institute, Engineering college road, Near fly over, Annamalai Nagar, Chidambaram - 2, on 7th April 2009, where classes were conducted for people who had walked in for want of hindi and english languages.</p>
                        <p>Veera's Education takes the privilege of serving the society broadly since it has analysed and extended its hard research towards the language need of Indian people, especially the South Indian people. We request each one of you, availing our product, to kindly follow all the protocols provided with our services for efficient learning.</p>
                        <p>"Service to mankind is service to God". We are glad and proud to serve the mankind.</p>
